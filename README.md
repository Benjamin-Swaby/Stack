# Stack

## About this program
This program is an abstract implimentation of a stack in zig.
The program has a stack of size 6 and will prompt the user to pop,push or peek elements of the stack.
This program has been designed with robustness in mind and also ease of use for both programmer and user giving an easy to work with abstraction of a stack

## Goals:
- Stack size of 6,
- User friendly,
- abillity to pop and push from the stack,
- should be able to handle overflows and empty stacks,

## Extra Features:
- The program can determine if what you have entered can be parsed as an integer and will allow it to be treated as such,
- A deep system of error management with error handling for **every** stack operation,
- An easy abstraction of the interface in the form of 2 structs with enums and custom error types,


## Limitations:
- By writing a user orientated program in Zig - all string parsing and user input has to be manually implimented
